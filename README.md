This project aims to perform an efficient feature selection on high-dimensional datasets through feature clustering. Two high-dimensional datasets are included here.

For continuous feature selection, please use the FC_1.py file

For discrete feature selection, please download the FC_2.py file with the entropy_estimators.py file.

Please cite the following articles for any use or modifications of this project.
